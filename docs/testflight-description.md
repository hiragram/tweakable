## Full Description (What to Test)

**Tweakable** helps you go from "saved recipe" to "dinner on the table."

**Core Features:**

- **Recipe Extraction**: Paste a URL from popular recipe sites (Cookpad, Allrecipes, Epicurious, Delish, Budget Bytes, and more), and we'll automatically extract the recipe details—ingredients, steps, and images.

- **AI-Powered Substitutions** (Premium): Tap any ingredient or cooking step to customize it. Replace "chicken with pork," change "deep frying to oven baking," or swap "milk for oat milk." Our AI automatically adjusts the entire recipe to match your changes.

- **Smart Shopping Lists**: Generate shopping lists from your recipes with ingredients organized by category (produce, meat, seasonings, etc.). Combine multiple recipes into a single shopping list.

- **Recipe Library**: Save your customized recipes locally for easy access anytime.

**What to Test:**

1. Try extracting recipes from different websites (both English and Japanese recipe sites are supported)
2. Test the substitution feature—try replacing ingredients based on dietary restrictions, allergies, or what you have in your fridge
3. Create shopping lists from saved recipes
4. Check the onboarding flow for first-time users

**Known Limitations:**

- Some recipe sites with heavy bot protection may not work
- Video-based recipes (TikTok, Instagram Reels) are not yet supported
- Portion scaling is not available in this version

**Subscription:**

The app offers a free tier with recipe extraction and shopping list features. The AI substitution feature requires a premium subscription.
